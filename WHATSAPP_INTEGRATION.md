## Conversation Flow Examples

### New User Experience

```
User: "Hi"
Bot: "üåü Welcome to SATA Mental Wellness Assistant!
     I'm here to support your mental health journey.
     Let's start by selecting your preferred language..."
```

### Assessment Initiation

```
User: "I want to check my mental health"
Bot: "üìã I'll guide you through a brief 4-question assessment
     to better understand how you're feeling..."
```

### Resource Request

```
User: "I need help with anxiety"
Bot: "üìö Here are anxiety resources available:
     1. üßò Mindfulness Techniques
     2. üè• Professional Services
     3. üìû Crisis Hotlines..."
```

## Localization

### Supported Languages

- **English (EN)**: Primary language
- **Chinese (ZH)**: Simplified Chinese for Chinese migrants
- **Bengali (BN)**: For Bangladeshi workers
- **Tamil (TA)**: For Tamil-speaking migrants
- **Myanmar (MY)**: For Myanmar migrant workers
- **Indonesian (ID)**: For Indonesian workers

### Text Management

All user-facing text is managed through the `getLocalizedText()` method in the message router, making it easy to add new languages or update existing translations.

## Production Considerations

### Scalability

- Session management with Redis (recommended)
- Database connection pooling
- Rate limiting for abuse prevention
- Message queue for high-volume processing

### Security

- Input validation and sanitization
- Crisis alert logging and monitoring
- User privacy protection
- Secure webhook verification

### Monitoring

- Conversation flow analytics
- Crisis intervention tracking
- User engagement metrics
- System performance monitoring

## Contributing

This system is designed to be extensible. To add new conversation flows:

1. Create a new flow handler in `src/lib/whatsapp/flows/`
2. Implement the standard flow interface
3. Add route detection logic to `message-router-clean.ts`
4. Update localization texts for all supported languages
